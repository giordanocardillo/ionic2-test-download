# Example for downloading and opening PDFs using ionic2


## Warning
This example 'as-is' works on android and iOS but on iOS it doesn't open the PDF file,
it just shows an empty share dialog. To make the example work in iOS you must
use the `cordova-plugin-file-opener2` version `2.0.19`. Using this version, beaks Android
compilation.
